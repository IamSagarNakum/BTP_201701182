\begin{abstract}
 India has the second-highest population in the world and around 70 per cent of the population of our country is heavily dependent on agriculture and we earn 65 per cent of money through agriculture.\\
 But when it comes to technology development for agriculture in India as compared to other countries than India is far behind other developing countries. So I aim to provide Agricultural equipment, Vehicles and Labours easily to farmers so that they can increase their efficiency and save their time.\\
 In modern days we will found a minimum of one person from every farmer's family who is using a smartphone so I have made AgriRent Application which will provide rent service to farmers, Using this app farmer can order Vehicle, Equipment and labours as per their need.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
AgriRent app has been developed using React Native platform.AgriRent application has been purely designed and made for only farmer's use. This application provides farmers easy renting service like vehicles, equipment and labours. Any farmer can order what they want through this app. This application also made for those farmers or people who want to give their vehicle, equipment and labours on rent. This application only made to make farmer's and renter's job easy they can save their time and get whatever they want on time.

Actual O/P : false\\
Remark : working fine\\
Test Case 3:\\
Custom I/P : 12345678901\\
Expected O/P : false\\
Actual O/P : false\\
Remark : working fine\\

\section{system testing}
1) Negative testing : \\
--While sign up I entered the wrong name and the wrong \\
email format to test it allow me to sign up  or not \\
--While changing the password i entered the wrong \\
password to see it password or not\\
--While ordering Vehicle/equipment I didn't enter mandatory \\
filled to test an order will be placed or not\\
--while ordering Vehicle/Equipment i enter wrong email\\
format to test it place order or not\\
Like this i test functionalities of application.\\
\\
2) Usability testing\\
I run this application in front of users of this application\\
and non users of this application to test what users feel about\\
this application\\
-- I run my app in front of farmers to test what they feel about\\
application\\
-- I run my app in front of engineers(my college friends) \\
to test what they feel about application\\
\\
Functional testing : I have taken lot of farmers interview \\
to know about what types of functionalities they want?\\
-- Farmers can order every vehicle and equipment\\ 
-- Farmers can place multiple orders\\
Non Functional testing : As i was developer of this i thought\\
-- Farmers can repeat same order by changing date and time\\
-- Farmers can Delete their account\\
-- Farmers can update their details
-- Farmers will get mail confirmation after placing orders\\
